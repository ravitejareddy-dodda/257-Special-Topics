Code Execution:

-To run the code in the local environment we use

-npm run dev

-this starts the local host to run the application we generated

Code Deployment:

steps:

-create a Vercel account, this helps in deploying front-end application with server less functionality

-Provide access to the GitHub repository for the app developped using vue, vite. link the repository with verscel’s deployment mechanism

-Once the necessary connections are provided the app is deployed using vercel.

-Once the app is deployed a special link is provided to access the app on the web
