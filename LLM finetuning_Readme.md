How to Proceed:
-Create a Basic Agent in Colab

-API Integration 

-Simulate Backend Responses

-Running the Notebook: run the agent continuously in a cell, or create an interactive interface using widgets in Colab.

b) Implement auto agent. Leverage auto agent to build a virtual company to do a project: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tqj5du0K3nejPC14wiZ1fpO5Il5FdSRQ

How to Proceed:

-Define the Virtual Event Planner Class

-Create an instance of the VirtualEventPlanner and simulate the tasks of each role.

c) Finetune LLM for your custom task: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C08JonpFm01ar3oQ_JkAf1EQErkeQzex?usp=sharing

Lora is employed to fine-tune language models, offering a tailored approach to adapt the model to a specific task or domain.

d) use QLora to finetune a model. generate custom data set.: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vLJTnF6eN_2YkOUO1i72qGW-nfT6uh1M?usp=sharing

QLora introduces a unique perspective on fine-tuning language models. This section provides insights into creating custom datasets and leveraging QLora for the fine-tuning process.

e) use mistral llm with RAG and demonstrate a production usecase: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HE5YNA2kAy1OLZaRAxnO27W6W6yIbnmn?usp=sharing

Mistral, in conjunction with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), enhances the capabilities of language models. This section demonstrates the fine-tuning of an LLM model with RAG and subsequently deploying it in a production use case.

f) integrate mistral model as backend with langchain - demonstrate simple prompts: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OBLktwiUjIq7Jp9oQXCsn01kJVSggoq6?usp=sharing

Integrating language models with external platforms is crucial for real-world applications. This section explores the integration of a Mistral model as a backend with Langchain. 

g) Quantize llm with ggml and gguf and build an end2end chat application on mobile phone and load the model and demonstrate using MLC end2end.: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16K86T64XeB7Jg4npfRuAukuYA_BEK58e?usp=sharing

Quantization is a technique used to reduce the size of language models, making them suitable for mobile applications.

h) Use LLM studio and LLM Data Studio to demonstrate data set generation, fine tuning, deployment to huggingface and inference (Gradio):https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WiE27Cfq0gQfnJnBru9uwP13i7vMB1pz?usp=sharing

LLM Studio and LLM Data Studio provide comprehensive tools for dataset generation, fine-tuning, and deployment. This section showcases the workflow using these studios, including deployment to Hugging Face and inference through Gradio.
