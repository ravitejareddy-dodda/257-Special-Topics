a) Colab, illustrating all the various prompt engineering techniques: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w4eKEhZjrvANOS8Js08Eqot6LqyOgHGt?usp=sharing
Content Overview:

Setup: Instructions on how to install the required libraries and set up the OpenAI API key

In-Context Learning (ICL): Demonstrates how providing examples within the prompt can guide the model to generate better responses.

Chain of Thought (CoT): Shows how breaking down a problem into smaller steps can lead to more accurate answers.

Iterated Chain of Thought (iCoT): illustrates the process of asking the model to think deeper and consider additional factors.

Textual Output Transformation (TOT): Explores how to transform the output format to match specific user expectations.

Generative Output Transformation (GOT): Demonstrates using the model to refine or transform its own outputs.

Asking Over Time (AOT): Shows how repeatedly asking the model the same question while incorporating previous answers can yield more comprehensive responses.

Refined Asking with Specified Constraints, Examples, and Follow-up (RASCEF): Combines various techniques to refine the prompt and achieve desired results.

Reason, Example, Ask, Check, Explain (REACT): Uses a structured approach to prompt the model and improve its responses.
