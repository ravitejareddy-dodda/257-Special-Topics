a) Colab, illustrating all the various prompt engineering techniques: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w4eKEhZjrvANOS8Js08Eqot6LqyOgHGt?usp=sharing
Content Overview:

Setup: Instructions on how to install the required libraries and set up the OpenAI API key

In-Context Learning (ICL): Demonstrates how providing examples within the prompt can guide the model to generate better responses.

Chain of Thought (CoT): Shows how breaking down a problem into smaller steps can lead to more accurate answers.

Iterated Chain of Thought (iCoT): illustrates the process of asking the model to think deeper and consider additional factors.

Textual Output Transformation (TOT): Explores how to transform the output format to match specific user expectations.

Generative Output Transformation (GOT): Demonstrates using the model to refine or transform its own outputs.

Asking Over Time (AOT): Shows how repeatedly asking the model the same question while incorporating previous answers can yield more comprehensive responses.

Refined Asking with Specified Constraints, Examples, and Follow-up (RASCEF): Combines various techniques to refine the prompt and achieve desired results.

Reason, Example, Ask, Check, Explain (REACT): Uses a structured approach to prompt the model and improve its responses.

c) Pick 10 diverse fields (like hr, teaching, finance etc..,) and write three very useful diverse prompts for each field with test cases: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pi1lVpfLs1FrH7ParP9X7n0sa0DSVySf?usp=sharing

Human Resources (HR)
Education
Finance
Healthcare
Information Technology (IT)
Marketing
Engineering
Hospitality
Law
Environmental Science

d) Implement the [https://platform.openai.com/examplesLinks to an external site.](https://platform.openai.com/examples) for palm 2 api: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18CRfFqRNuTG5ChRbbrEZhwpG4Gy9ZHu0?usp=sharing

The query_openai function is demonstrated using a translation prompt, showcasing how to obtain a response from the API.

e) write function calls api example colab usecase of openai: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iTxEqEaxQ-YbqvZmD0b8NqR2IMeNVPRO?usp=sharing

This example will send a request to the OpenAI API asking for a summary of the latest research on climate change. The call_openai_api function can be reused for any prompt you wish to send to the API, and you can adjust the model and max_tokens parameters as needed.

f) write system prompt example usecase of openai:  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qw7HLFwBImc1LqIYmi0bpbsL2DnCAxsB?usp=sharing

This example will send a request to the OpenAI API to generate content for a blog post focused on healthy eating. The output will be a detailed and informative piece that can be used for a blog or article. The call_openai_api function can be tailored with different parameters such as temperature to adjust the creativity of the response, and max_tokens to set the length of the content.
